We report here that the C57Bl6 mouse model of experimental infection with the closely related H. felis recapitulates this wide range in host susceptibility. A majority of infected mice develop premalignant lesions such as gastric atrophy, compensatory epithelial hyperplasia and intestinal metaplasia, whereas a minority is completely protected from preneoplasia. Protection is associated with the failure to mount an IFN-gamma response to the infection and an associated high Helicobacter burden. We demonstrate that IFN-gamma is essential for clearance of Helicobacter, but also mediates the formation of preneoplastic lesions. We further provide evidence that IFN-gamma triggers a specific transcriptional program in murine gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and induces their preferential transformation to the hyperplastic phenotype. In summary, our data suggest a dual role for IFN-gamma in Helicobacter pathogenesis that could provide an explanation for the differential susceptibility to H. pylori-induced gastric pathology in the human population.Keywords: response to in vitro stimulus / comparison of histopathological states", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE13873"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Jan 20, 2010", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "In vivo actin cross-linking induced by type VI secretion system is associated with intestinal inflammation", "overall_design": "3 infection groups (mock, V52, ACD), 3 biological replicates per group.", "summary": "To determine whether the Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system (T6SS) is functional during animal infection, derivatives of V52 were used to infect infant mice.

Therefore, the current study aimed to (i) investigate the dynamics of new collagen formation in mice using bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in which newly synthesized collagen was labelled with deuterated water and (ii) use this information to identify genes and processes correlated to new collagen formation from gene expression analysis.Lung fibrosis was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by bleomycin instillation and sacrificed. Animals were sacrificed at 1 to 5 weeks after fibrosis induction. Collagen synthesized during the week before sacrifice was labelled with deuterium by providing mice with deuterated drinking water. After sacrifice, lung tissue was collected for microarray analysis, determination of new collagen formation, and histology. Deuterated water labelling showed a strong increase in new collagen formation already during the first week after fibrosis induction and a complete return to baseline at five weeks. Correlation of new collagen formation data with gene expression data revealed fibrosis specific processes, of which proliferation was an unexpected one. This was confirmed by measuring cell proliferation and collagen synthesis simultaneously using deuterated water incorporation. Furthermore, new collagen formation strongly correlated with gene expression of e.g. elastin, tenascin C, MMP-14, lysyl oxidase, and type V collagen.

MUC2 homo-oligomerizes intracellularly into large secreted polymers which give mucus its viscous properties. The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ulcerative colitis is characterized by depleted goblet cells and a reduced mucus layer, whereas goblet cells and the mucus layer are increased in the other major inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s disease.Methods and FindingsBy murine N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenesis we identified two distinct non-complementing missense mutations in Muc2 exons encoding N- and C-terminal homo-oligomerization domains causing an ulcerative colitis-like phenotype.  Both strains developed mild spontaneous distal intestinal inflammation, chronic diarrhea, rectal bleeding and prolapse, increased susceptibility to acute and chronic colitis induced by a luminal toxin, aberrant Muc2 biosynthesis, smaller goblet cell thecae (less stored mucin) and a diminished mucus barrier. Enhanced local production of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was seen in the distal colon.  The number of leukocytes within mesenteric lymph nodes was increased five-fold and leukocytes cultured in vitro produced both Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-13). Intestinal permeability was increased and the luminal bacterial flora were more heavily coated with immunoglobulin as occurs in IBD. This pathology was accompanied by accumulation of the Muc2 precursor and ultrastructural and biochemical evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in goblet cells, activation of the unfolded protein response, and altered intestinal expression of genes involved in ER stress, inflammation, apoptosis and wound repair. Expression of mutated Muc2 oligomerization domains in vitro demonstrated that aberrant Muc2 oligomerization underlies the ER stress. These models show that mutations in Muc2 oligomerization domains can lead to aberrant assembly of the Muc2 complex leading to ER stress, a depleted mucus barrier and intestinal inflammation.  In ulcerative colitis we demonstrate similar accumulation of non-glycosylated MUC2 precursor in goblet cells together with ultrastructural and biochemical evidence of ER stress even in non-inflamed intestinal tissue.ConclusionsThe observations that mucin misfolding and ER stress lead directly to intestinal inflammation and that ER stress and goblet cell pathology occur in ulcerative colitis suggest that ER stress-related mucin depletion could be a fundamental component of the pathogenesis of colitis.Keywords: Single gene, multiple mutant comparison", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE9913"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Sep 01, 2008", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Noise-Induced Changes in Gene Expression in the Cochleae of Mice Differing in Their Susceptibility to Noise Damage", "overall_design": "Female 10-wk-old mice of the B6.CAST and 129X1/SvJ strains were divided randomly into non-noise control and noise-exposure groups.

Measurements of noise-induced gene expression changes 6 h after the noise exposure revealed significant alterations in the expression levels of 48 genes in the resistant mice, while by these same criteria, there were seven differentially expressed genes in the susceptible B6.CAST mice. Differentially expressed genes in both groups of mice included subsets of transcription factors.

Here we describe the first method for the isolation and purification of developing and mature astrocytes from mouse forebrain.  This method takes advantage of the expression of S100\u03b2 by astrocytes.  We used fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate EGFP positive cells from transgenic mice that express EGFP under the control of an S100\u03b2 promoter.  By depletion of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes we obtained purified populations of neurons, while by panning with oligodendrocyte-specific antibodies we obtained purified populations of oligodendrocytes.  Using GeneChip Arrays we then created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of over 20,000 genes by gene profiling these three main CNS neural cell types at postnatal ages day 1 to 30.  This database provides the first global characterization of the genes expressed by mammalian astrocytes in vivo and is the first direct comparison between the astrocyte, neuron, and oligodendrocyte transcriptomes.  We demonstrate that Aldh1L1, a highly expressed astrocyte gene, is a highly specific antigenic marker for astrocytes with a substantially broader, and therefore potentially more useful, pattern of astrocyte expression than the traditional astrocyte marker GFAP.  This transcriptome database of acutely isolated and highly pure populations of astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes provides a resource to the neuroscience community by providing improved cell type specific markers and for better understanding of neural development, function, and disease.We acutely purified mouse astrocytes from early postnatal ages (P1) to later postnatal ages (P30), when astrocyte differentiation is morphologically complete (Bushong et al., 2004), and acutely purified mouse OL-lineage cells from stages ranging from OPCs to newly differentiated OLs to myelinating OLs.  We extracted RNA from each of these highly purified, acutely isolated cell types and used GeneChip Arrays to determine the expression levels of over 20,000 genes and construct a comprehensive database of cell type specific gene expression in the mouse forebrain.

Earlier work identified Ca2+-activated potassium channels of small and intermediate conductance (SKCas) as important regulators of neural stem cell fate. Here, we have investigated their impact on the differentiation of pluripotent cells towards the cardiac lineage. Methods and Results: We have applied the SKCa-activator EBIO on embryonic stem cells and identified this particular ion channel family as a new critical target involved in the generation of cardiac pacemaker-like cells: SKCa-activation led to rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, inhibition of proliferation, induction of differentiation and diminished teratoma formation. Time-restricted SKCa-activation induced cardiac mesoderm and commitment to the cardiac lineage as shown by gene regulation, protein and functional electrophysiological studies. In addition, the differentiation into cardiomyocytes was modulated in a qualitative fashion, resulting in a strong enrichment of pacemaker-like cells. This was accompanied by induction of the sino-atrial gene program and in parallel by a loss of the chamber-specific myocardium. In addition, SKCa activity induced activation of the Ras-Mek-Erk signaling cascade, a signaling pathway involved in the EBIO-induced effects.Conclusions: SKCa-activation drives the fate of pluripotent cells towards the cardiac lineage and preferentially into pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes. This provides a novel strategy for the enrichment of cardiomyocytes and in particular, the generation of a specific subtype of cardiomyocytes, pacemaker-like cells, without genetic modification.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE18660"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Oct 23, 2012", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "PTP1B deficiency effect on mammary gland development and differentiation", "overall_design": "Mouse mammary glands were isolated from PTP1B -/- and PTP1B +/+ nulliparous mice at estrous and pregnancy day 3, 7, 10 and 15 for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.", "summary": "Analysis of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) deficient mammary glands from nulliparous mice at estrous and pregnancy day 3, 7, 10 and 15.

Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13, collagenase-3) is a wide spectrum proteinase. Its expression and function is linked to the growth and invasion of many epithelial cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, the physiologic expression of MMP-13 is associated e.g. to scarless healing of human fetal skin and adult gingival wounds. While MMP-13 is not found in the normally healing skin wounds in human adults, it is expressed in mouse skin during wound healing. Thus, mouse wound healing models can be utilized for studying the role of MMP-13 in the events of wound healing. As the processes such as the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes, angiogenesis, inflammation and activation of fibroblasts are components of wound repair as well as of cancer, many results received from wound healing studies are also adaptable to cancer research.Classically, the process of wound healing can be devided into three phases which are histologically and functionally separate but temporally overlapping: 1) hemostasis and inflammation, 2) re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation, and 3) matrix remodeling. Granulation tissue is formed into the wound via fibroplasia, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by fibroblasts. Granulation tissue is rich in inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and blood vessels. After epidermal recovery, the granulation tissue is resolved via matrix remodeling and cell apoptosis. A sterile viscose cellulose sponge (VCS) characterized by defined size and structure can be used to experimentally induce formation of subcutaneous granulation tissue.

Considering that ectopic expression of c-Myc causes tumourigenicity in offspring and retroviruses themselves can cause insertional mutagenesis, the generation of iPS cells with a minimal number of factors may hasten the clinical application of this approach.

Nevertheless, an early embryonic failure in pre-implantation development was identified and likely accounted for the sub-fertility phenotype.  These results suggest that basonuclin is a new member of the mammalian maternal-effect genes and interestingly, differs from the previously reported mammalian maternal-effect genes in that it also apparently perturbs oogenesis.Keywords: RNAi knockdown", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE4029"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Jun 06, 2006", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "oksen-affy-mouse-212956", "overall_design": null, "summary": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS that is mediated by T cells and macrophages and represents the paradigmatic model for multiple sclerosis (MS). In EAE, therapeutic approaches targeting T cells have been successfully utilized leading to immunosuppression or tolerance. It has been recently shown that mesenchimal stem cells (MSC) isolated from C57BL/6J mice are an effective treatment of EAE induced by the encephalitogenic peptide pMOG 35-55. In this project we aim to track and evaluate the molecular changes the MSC acquire through several in-vitro passages that determine their therapeutic potential. Elucidation of the molecular pathways involved in this process will allow us to formulate better models of disease progression and curative strategies.Specific aim:The specific aim of this proposal is to dissect the molecular pathways that mesenchimal stem cells undergo during in-vitro treatment and confer them the therapeutic potential to cure EAE. To accomplish this aim, we will purify and grow murine MSC under the same conditions used for therapy as described in Zappia et al (In press. Brain, 2005) and obtain samples at several stages of the culture. RNA will be purified from each sample and profiled using Affymetrix microarrays. Initial bioinformatics analysis will include data transformation, normalization and filtering. A second stage analysis will involve time-series analysis by ANOVA and dynamic events modeling using neural networks.Stem cells are now viewed as potential source of cells for almost any tissue due to their postulated capacity to give rise to virtually any type of cell. Among them, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), can extensively proliferate in vitro and differentiate under appropriate conditions in bone, cartilage, and other mesenchymal tissues. It has been also reported that MSC can differentiate into other cells types including neuroectodermal cells. Furthermore, upon tissue injury MSC have been shown to migrate into the damaged brain. These results suggest that MSC could provide an ideal cell source for repair of injured organs including the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to their plasticity, MSC have been recently demonstrated to suppress several T lymphocyte activities thus exerting an immunoregulatory capacity both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms mediating such effect are only partially understood. We hypothesize that an analysis of how MSC acquire their therapeutic potential in vitro by expression profiling in a time series fashion will allow us to dissect the involved mechanisms.Before arriving to our lab in UCSF, samples will be processed as follows: Bone marrow from 6-8 weeks old C57BL/6J mice will be flushed out of tibias and femurs. After two washings by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min in PBS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), cells will be plated in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks at the concentration of 0.3-0.4 x 106 cells/cm2 utilizing Murine Mesencult as medium (Stem Cell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Cells will be kept in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C for about 4-5 weeks, when only adherent cells will be collected following 10 min incubation at 37\u00b0C with 0.05% trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA. After the first cut and for the subsequent 4 or 5 passages, cells will be plated in 25 cm2 flasks at 1.2-2.0 x 104cells/cm2 . For the following passages cells will routinely seeded at 4-10 x 103cells/cm2 reaching confluence only after 4-5 days.

As the mice aged, adventitial T cells formed T/T cell-, T/B cell-, and T/B/dendritic cell aggregates adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions. Some of the adventitial infiltrates formed large clusters of various immune cells including T cells, B cells (centrocytes, follicular mantle cells), dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, and plasma cells with preferential formation in the suprarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. These data demonstrated that the immune lineage cell composition of atherosclerotic lesions and adventitia were distinct: The macrophage-foam cell-, T cell-, and SMC-dominated cell composition of atherosclerosis lesions versus the presence of immune cells capable of carrying out antigen-dependent T cell-driven humoral immune responses in the adventitia also indicated that immune reactions carried out in lesions or the adventitia are fundamentaly different. To distinguish between immunity-regulating genes in atherosclerosis lesions versus the adventitia, a combination of microarray profiling and laser capture microdissection was used. Stringent filters revealed 1163 differentially up-regulated probesets in apoE-/- mouse aortae at 78 weeks (w) versus 6 w. A fuzzy c-means cluster algorythm identified 2 clusters that significantly differed in their slope angles between time points: An apparent atherosclerosis cluster consisted of 771 probesets and an apparent adventitia cluster consisted of 392 probesets. Up-regulated genes at 32 w mirrored the influx of monocyte/macrophages into intima lesions whereas genes up-regulated between 32-78 w mirrored adventitial inflammation. To segregate both clusters into separate gene ontology (GO) molecular function groups, we determined statistically significant up-regulation (unpaired Student t-test; p &lt; 0.05) between 6-32 w for the atherosclerosis cluster and between 32-78 w for the adventitia cluster. Among others, GO molecular function terms cytokine activity, cytokine binding, and immunoglobulin binding in the atherosclerosis cluster and cytokine activity, chemokine receptor activity, and antigen binding in the ATLO cluster suggested candidate genes in relation to inflammation triggered by macrophages or adventitia infiltration, respectively. Among other prototype atherosclerosis genes such as Itgax (complement receptor 4), Cd68, Lysz (lysozyme), Vcam1, and Icam1, the atherosclerosis cluster showed markedly overrepresented prototype macrophage/foam cell genes regulating inflammation in cytokine activity (GO: 0005125): Spp1 (osteopontin) and Il6; in cytokine binding (GO: 0019955) Cd74, Il10rb, Ccr2, and Ccr5; and in immunoglobulin binding (GO: 00119865) the proinflammatory galactose-binding lectin Lgals3, as well as genes in scavenger receptor activity and lipid transporter activity. By contrast, the adventitia cluster showed overrepresented genes regulating B cell recruitment, B cell maturation, germinal center formation, and autoimmunity in cytokine activity including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, in CXC chemokine receptor activity the secondary lymphoid organ counterreceptor of CXCL13 Blr1 (also known as Cxcr5), Cxcr3, and Cxcr6; and in antigen binding several histocompatibility-2 loci and various markedly expressed immunoglobulin genes. As embryonic lymph node development and tertiary lymphoid organ neogenesis share common features signal intensities of genes specifying the GO molecular function term lymph node development (GO: 0048535) were examined in arrays prepared from wild-type and apoE-/- aortae. These results showed that Id2, Nfkb1, and Ltbr were constitutively expressed at significant levels in aortae of both mouse genotypes whereas other genes including Lta, Ltb, Glycam1, and the two lymphorganogenic genes Cxcl13 and Ccl21 were induced at 78 w in apoE-deficient aortae only. Thus, genes expressed by macrophage-foam cells and genes regulating ATLO neogenesis, embryonic lymph node development, or B cell maturation were constitutively expressed in the arterial wall in both genotypes or emerged in a stepwise fashion at 32 w and 78 w. To verify microarray signal intensity data, separate aortae extracts were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type and apoE-deficient mice at 32 and 78 w. These data showed that array signal values accurately reflected gene transcripts. Cell lineage analyses of the adventitial infiltrate and kinetic aorta microarray- and QRT-PCR analyses thus provided circumstantial evidence that immune responses in atherosclerosis intima lesions and the adventitia were distinct. To examine this possibility further, we selected areas of the abdominal aorta burdened with advanced lesions and separated lesions and corresponding adventitial infiltrates of 78 w old apoE-deficient mice by laser dissection microscopy. In addition, adventitiae of aorta segments that were not associated with adjacent lesions and adventitiae of wild-type mice were prepared. Consistent with the lack of a major adventitial leukocyte infiltration, wild-type adventitiae showed gene expression levels that were similar to lesion-free adventitiae of apoE-deficient mice indicating that atherosclerotic lesions directly affected adventitial inflammation in a segmental fashion. Stringent filter criteria identified genes that were differentially expressed in adventitiae and atherosclerotic lesions. Statistical analyses of overrepresented genes in GO molecular function or biological process groups were particularly instructive in cytokine activity, cytokine binding, antigen processing and presentation as well as in lymph node development. Thus, adventitiae in aorta segments with associated atherosclerotic lesions in cytokine activity showed overrepresentation of genes known to be associated with tertiary lymphoid organ formation including Cxcl13, Ccl21, and Ltb, whereas atherosclerotic lesions showed overrepresentation of prototype atherosclerosis-associated genes Ssp1 (osteopontin), Bmp4 (bone morphogenic protein 4), and Cxc3cl1 (fractalkine); in cytokine binding adventitiae showed overrepresentation of receptors implicated in B cell immunity and autoimmunity including Brl1 (counterreceptor for CXCL13), Ccr7, Tnfrsf4, and Cxcr3 whereas lesions showed overrepresentation of inflammatory mediator receptors including Tnfrs1b, Tgfbr1, and Il7r; moreover, in antigen processing and presentation, adventitiae showed overrepresentation of several histocompatibility loci; additional adventitial gene expression overrepresentations were observed in lymph node development (Fas, SpiB, Ltb, Flt3) whereas lesions showed expression of prototype macrophage genes including Tlr4, Tgfb1, and Tgfb2.  These data provide comprehensive topographical transcriptome information in adventitial tissue adjacent to atherosclerotic lesions versus lesions and are expected to form the basis for future cell lineage expression analyses using single cell detection methodology including ISH.Keywords: Atherosclerosis, aorta transcriptomes, adventitia, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, immune response, tertiary lymphoid organogenesis", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE10000"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Mar 29, 2012", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Integral roles for Rev-erb alpha and Rev-erb beta in the circadian clock function [Expression array]", "overall_design": "Total RNA was obtained from livers of wild-type and Liver-specific Reverb alpha/beta double knockout mice at ZT 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.", "summary": "The circadian clock acts at the genomic level to coordinate internal behavioral and physiologic rhythms via the CLOCK-BMAL transcriptional heterodimer.

There are nine disorders each having distinct features but also clinical and pathological similarities.  In particular, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and type 7 (SCA1 and SCA7) patients manifest cerebellar ataxia with degeneration of Purkinje cells.  To determine whether the disorders share molecular pathogenic events, we studied two mouse models of SCA1 and SCA7 that express the glutamine-expanded protein from the respective endogenous loci.  We found common transcriptional changes, with down-regulation of Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (Igfbp5) representing one of the most robust changes.  Igfbp5 down-regulation occurred in granule neurons through a non-cell autonomous mechanism and was concomitant with activation of of the Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway and the type I IGF receptor on Purkinje cells.  These data define one common pathogenic response in SCA1 and SCA7 and reveal the importance of intercellular mechanisms in their pathogenesis.  Given that SCA1 and SCA7 share a cerebellar degenerative phenotype, we proposed that some shared molecular changes might occur in both diseases, and that common molecular alterations could pinpoint pathways that could be targeted to modulate or monitor the pathogenesis of more than one disease.

We have used a genome-wide gene expression analysis approach to (i) define which fraction of LPS target genes are subject to tolerance induction and (ii) identify genes that are expressed at high levels in tolerant macrophages. Our data show that in LPS tolerant macrophages the vast majority of LPS-induced gene expression is abrogated. The extent of tolerance induction varies for individual genes, and a small subset appears to be excepted. Compared to other negative control mechanisms of macrophages, e.g. IL-10-induced deactivation, LPS-tolerance inhibits a much wider range of transcriptional targets.

Within the translation process, the first stage of translation initiation is most rigorously modulated by the actions of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and their associated proteins.  These 11 eIFs catalyze the joining of the tRNA, mRNA and rRNA into a functional translation complex.  Their activity is influenced by a wide variety of extra- and intracellular signals, ranging from global, such as hormone signaling and unfolded proteins, to specific, such as single amino acid imbalance and iron deficiency.  Their action is correspondingly comprehensive, in increasing or decreasing recruitment and translation of most cellular mRNAs, and specialized, in targeting translation of mRNAs with regulatory features such as a 5\u2019 terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), upstream open reading frames (uORFs), or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES).  In mammals, two major pathways are linked to targeted mRNA translation.  The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase induces translation of TOP and perhaps other subsets of mRNAs, whereas a family of eIF2 kinases does so with mRNAs containing uORFs or an IRES.  TOR targets translation of mRNAs that code for proteins involved in translation, an action compatible with its widely accepted role in regulating cellular growth.  The four members of the eIF2 kinase family increase translation of mRNAs coding for stress response proteins such as transcription factors and chaperones.  Though all four kinases act on one main substrate, eIF2, published literature demonstrates both common and unique effects by each kinase in response to its specific activating stress.  This suggests that the activated eIF2 kinases regulate the translation of both a global and a specific set of mRNAs.  Up to now, few studies have attempted to test such a hypothesis; none has been done in mammals.We use array analysis to determine the global mRNA shift into polysomes following a stress response, and to compare the translational response following activation of GCN2 versus PERK, two of the four eIF2alpha kinases.Keywords: stress response, comparative genomic", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE11684"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Dec 21, 2011", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Single Cell based genomewide gene expression analysis of murine bone-marrow derived Very Small Embryonic-Like Stem Cells (VSELs)", "overall_design": "T7-primed cDNA libraries was synthesized using FACS sorted twenty cells.

Notably, spontaneous or RNA interference-enforced down-regulation of Ezh2 during VSEL differentiation removes the bivalent-domain (BD) structure, which leads to de-repression of several BD-regulated genes.

Molecules involved in Treg effector function, chemokine receptors, and the transcription factors that control them are differentially represented in these subphenotypes.

Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures.

In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.Keywords: genetic modification", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE9803"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Jul 16, 2003", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Genetic basis of sensitivity to pulmonary fibrosis", "overall_design": null, "summary": "The murine pulmonary response is strain specific.

Results: We used genome-wide expression profiling to investigate the aging skin transcriptome. In humans, age-related shifts in gene expression were sex-specific. In females, aging increased expression of transcripts associated with T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells, and decreased expression of genes in regions with elevated Zeb1, AP-2 and YY1 motif density. In males, however, these effects were contrasting or absent. When age-associated gene expression patterns in human skin were compared to those in tail skin from CB6F1 mice, overall human-mouse correspondence was weak. Moreover, inflammatory gene expression patterns were not induced with aging of mouse tail skin, and well-known aging biomarkers were in fact decreased (e.g., Clec7a, Lyz1 and Lyz2). These unexpected patterns and weak human-mouse correspondence may be due to decreased abundance of antigen presenting cells in mouse tail skin with age.  Conclusions: Aging is generally associated with a pro-inflammatory state, but we have identified an exception to this pattern with aging of CB6F1 mouse tail skin. Aging therefore does not uniformly heighten inflammatory status across all mouse tissues. Furthermore, we identified both intercellular and intracellular mechanisms of transcriptome aging, including those that are sex- and species-specific.We used Affymetrix microarrays to evaluate genome-wide expression in tail skin from young (5 month) and old (30 month) CB6F1 mice (males and females).", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE35322"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on May 01, 2013", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Dicer deficiency reveals microRNAs predicted to control gene expression in developing adrenal cortex", "overall_design": "Refer to individual Series", "summary": "This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by arrayExpression profiling by RT-PCR"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE45812"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Nov 23, 2012", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Longitudinal expression data from CD8+ T cells responding to LCMV-Armstrong or LCMV-Clone 13", "overall_design": "Naive CD44Lo CD8+ T cells were isolated and sorted from uninfected C57BL/6 mice and H2-Db GP33-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted using MHC-I tetramers at d6, 8, 15, and 30 p.i. with either LCMV Arm or LCMV clone 13.

Some mice progress and die, while their littermates recover and get better, despite the same mutation on an inbred genetic background. We find evidence for glycine neurotransmitter toxicity and loss of glycinergic interneurons early in the disease, but some mice are able to keep things going until they can over-express homomeric alpha1 channels, whereupon they recover. In the mice progressing towards lethality, neurotransmitter toxicity too quickly extends to GABAergic interneurons and motorneurons, and they lose their window of time to upregulate the alpha1 glycine receptor, and they crash and burn. Importantly, human patients with glycine receptor defects typically show a resolution of their phenotype with age, and we propose that the same remodeling events are occuring in human patients.Hypothesis:Our data suggests that functional recovery of GlyRb mutant mice is likely due to expression of homomeric glycine receptors, rescue from excitotoxicity, and subsequent neuronal remodeling. We propose that human patients with hyperekplexia (mutations of glycine receptors) show remodeling similar to that of the recovering spastic mice, as human patients also show a lessening of symptoms as a function of age.Specific Aim:Murine models for human Startle Disease show clinical variability between littermates. Here, we determined the molecular remodeling of spastic GlyRb mutant spinal cord through the course of the disease, and develop a model for clinical disparity between littermates. At young ages, all animals were spastic, showed loss of glycine receptors, increased expression of vesicular glycine/GABA transporter and NMDA receptors, induction of activated caspase3, and preferential loss of glycinergic interneurons consistent with neurotransmitter toxicity model. Those littermates that recovered from symptoms showed strong over-expression of the GlyRa1 subunit, and increased myelination and synaptic plasticity. Littermates that showed a deteriorating clinical course failed to over-express GlyRa1, and also showed relative loss of gephyrin. These molecular changes were associated with preferential loss of GABAergic interneurons, and extensive motorneuron loss.Keywords: other", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE1800"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Mar 02, 2012", "organisms": "Mus musculus", "title": "Expression data for OVE26 diabetic mouse podocyte", "overall_design": "Podocyte eGFP transgenic mice were made on FVB background and crossbred to OVE26 diabetic model.

Therefore, in this study we intended to gain insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of Hep against clinical EV71 infection in neural cells.  Instead of stating a long list of gene functions and pathways, we tried to select for EV71-induced genes that were exclusively affected by antiviral activity of Hep through a multi-level comparison and characterization.Overall, the findings of this study suggest several molecular targets by which Hep might exert its antiviral activity against clinical EV71 infection in neural cells.  Mostly, Hep appeared to modulate induction effect of EV71 on several genes in a way that may benefit the host cell and inhibit the viral infection.  The most important genes where expression patterns were significantly changed by Hep include genes related to; (i) cell growth, (ii) DNA repair and replication, (iii) cytoplasmic microfilaments and related apoptosis, (iv) regulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrion-related apoptosis, (v) cytoplasmic viral transport, (vi) transmembrane proteins and the related signaling pathways, (vii) phosphoribosyltransferase, (viii) transcription factors, (ix) G protein-coupled receptors and G protein-coupled receptors-interacting proteins, (x) remodeling actin filament assembly, (xi) chemokin receptors, and (xii) immunosuppression.  In addition, Hep sometimes appeared to be harmful for cells, like the case in that Hep likely suppresses regulation of Metallothionein 1E.  Furthermore, it should not be ignored that the Hep-caused affects seen in this microarray analysis may partially be attributed to a significant inhibitory effect of Hep on EV71 entry into the cells.In conclusion, we propose that our microarray findings may suggest new directions for further studies on molecular targets of anti-EV71 activity of Hep.  EV71 is a neurovirological virus that can cause severe and fatal CNS complications in infected patients.  There is no approved drug for prophylaxis of EV71-casued disease and discovering a molecular drug target(s) for EV71 infection would be beneficial.

This study will evoke the fundamental misinterpretation including underestimation of the prognostic evaluation power of markers by overestimation of EMT in past cancer research, and will furnish some advice for the near future as follows: 1) Understanding how long the tissues were under an ischemic condition; 2) Prevalence of biopsy samples for in vivo expression profiling with low biases on basic and clinical research; and 3) Checking cancer cell contents and normal- or necrotic-tissue contamination in biopsy samples for prevalence.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE32700"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Feb 11, 2009", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Paired MEK inhibited and control", "overall_design": "Cell lines growing in culture (n=12) and murine xenografts (n=2) were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 or vehicle alone as control.

Data in humans elucidating the molecular mechanism of probiotic action are still scarce. To this end, we used an organ culture system of human colon mucosa and investigated the gene expression profiles after treatment with different probiotic bacteria in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin (IO)) stimulated samples using whole genome microarrays. Moreover, we analyzed changes occurring in the intestinal explants cultured for 8 hours when compared to fresh, directly frozen mucosa, in order to infer the suitability of the system to study an inflammatory stimulus and likely antiinflammatory responses. Results: Culturing intestinal colon fragments during 8 hours elicited differential gene expression in 283 genes, 229 upregulated and 54 downregulated. Upregulated genes were predominantly related to apoptosis, whereas downregulated genes encoded mitochondrial proteins. No specific enrichment of genes related to inflammation or immune response could be detected, confirming the suitability of the system to further study the inmunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory properties of Lactobacillus casei BL23 (BL23), L.plantarum 299v (LP299v) and L.plantarum 299v (A-) (LP299v (A-)), a mutant strain with reduced adhesive properties to enterocytes. Intestinal explants were stimulated with PMA/IO for 3 hours and subsequently incubated with probiotic bacteria for 4 h. ANOVA analysis (p \u2264 0,01) revealed 205 differentially expressed genes between Control, PMA/IO (Inflamed), and the 3 bacterial treatments. Most importantly, a number of PMA/IO induced genes related to immune response and immune system process such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL17A and pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL9 and CXCL11 were downregulated by BL23, LP299v and LP299v (A-). The behaviour of the three Lactobacillus strains was quite similar, although their presence induced differential expression of a small number of genes in a strain dependent manner. Conclusion: The human colon organ culture was found to be a suitable model for the study of inflammatory/anti-inflammatory stimuli, and therefore it constitutes a valuable tool to determine the inmunomodulatory effect of probiotic bacteria.

One way to assess the relative importance of alterations in the transcriptome profile is to combine complementary analyses that assess changes in the copy number alterations (CNAs). This integrated  analysis  permits the identification of genes with altered expression that map within specific chromosomal regions that demonstrate copy number alterations, providing a mechanistic approach to  identify the 'driver genes\u2019.Methods:  We have performed whole genome analysis of CNAs using the Affymetrix 250K Mapping array on 22 infiltrating ductal carcinoma samples (IDCs). Analysis of transcript expression alterations was performed using the Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 array on 16 IDC samples. Twelve IDC samples were analyzed using both platforms and the data integrated. We also incorporated data from LOH analysis to identify genes showing loss of expression in LOH regions.Results:  Copy number analysis results demarcated smaller boundaries for many previously reported CNAs, and in some cases, the CNAs were defined as more than a single contiguous event. Additionally, we were able to assign driver genes to these commonly reported regions using a rigorous methodology. For example, RAB25 showed a large increased expression in the tumors and mapped to the commonly reported amplification at 1q22. We also identified 5 genes in the 8q24 amplicon and TSEN4 in the 17q25 amplified region. LOH analysis confirmed some previously reported regions, and integration with copy number data determined that the detected LOH were copy neutral events. Finally, we have identified several RXR pathways that demonstrated down-regulation in IDC whose members may represent further targets of therapeutic intervention.Conclusion: We have demonstrated the utility of the application of integrated analysis using high-resolution CGH and whole genome transcript analysis for detecting driver genes in IDC. The high resolution platform allowed a refined demarcation of CNAs, and gene expression profiling provided a mechanism to detect genes directly impacted by the CNA.

We have analyzed how SUMOylation influences the activity of endogenous GR target genes and the receptor chromatin binding by using isogenic HEK293 cells expressing wild-type GR (wtGR) or SUMOylation-defective GR (GR3KR). Gene expression profiling revealed that both dexamethasone up- and down-regulated genes are affected by the GR sumoylation and that the affected genes are significantly associated with pathways of cellular proliferation and survival. The GR3KR-expressing cells proliferated more rapidly and their anti-proliferative response to dexamethasone was less pronounced than in the wtGR-expressing cells. ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the SUMOylation modulates the chromatin occupancy of GR on several loci associated with cellular growth in a fashion which parallels with their differential dexamethasone-regulated expression between the two cell lines. Moreover, genome-wide SUMO-2/3 marks, which were generally associated with active chromatin, showed markedly higher overlap with the wtGR cistrome than with the GR3KR cistrome.

Although 1,25(OH)2D3 pharmacological concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 may exert antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cell lines, much uncertainty remains about the effects of calcitriol supplementation in tumor specimens in vivo. We have evaluated tumor dimension (ultrassonography), proliferative index (Ki67 expression), 25(OH)D3 serum concentration and gene expression profile, before and after a short term calcitriol supplementation (dose to prevent osteoporosis) to post-menopausal patients. Results: Thirty three patients with operable disease had tumor samples evaluated. Most of them (87.5%) presented 25(OH)D3 insufficiency (&lt;30 ng/mL). Median period of calcitriol supplementation was 30 days. Although tumor dimension did not vary, Ki67 immunoexpression decreased after supplementation. Transcriptional analysis of 15 matched pre/post-supplementation samples using U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix) revealed 18 genes over-expressed in post-supplementation tumors. As a technical validation procedure, expression of four genes was also determined by RT-qPCR and a direct correlation was observed between both methods (microarray vs PCR). To further explore the effects of near physiological concentrations of calcitriol on breast cancer samples, an ex vivo model of fresh tumor slices was utilized. Tumor samples from another 12 post-menopausal patients were sliced and treated in vitro with slightly high concentrations of calcitriol (0.5nM), that can be attained in vivo, for 24 hours In this model, expression of PBEF1, EGR1, ATF3, FOS and RGS1 was not induced after a short exposure to calcitriol. Conclusions: In our work, most post-menopausal breast cancer patients presented at least 25(OH)D3 insufficiency. In these patients, a short period of calcitriol supplementation may prevent tumor growth and reduce Ki67 expression, probably associated with discrete transcriptional changes.

Genes highly expressed in HPV(+) samples included cell cycle regulators (p16INK4A, p18 and CDK2) and transcription factors (TAF7L, RFC4, RPA2 and TFDP2). The microarray data were also investigated using DIGMap to map genes by chromosomal location. A large number of genes on chromosome 3q24-qter was found to be overrepresented in HPV(+) tumors. Conclusion: The gene expression profile associated with HPV reflects alterations in cell cycle and proliferation signals. Further investigation of differentially expressed genes may reveal the unique pathways in HPV(+) tumors that may explain the different natural history and biological properties of these tumors. These properties may be exploited as a target of novel therapeutic agents in HNSCC treatment.Keywords: HPV, HNSCC, head and neck cancer, human, human papilloma virus", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE3292"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Apr 07, 2005", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Transcriptional Profiling of Untreated, HIV-1 Vector-Infected and TNFalpha-treated Jurkat T cells", "overall_design": null, "summary": "Jurkat T cells (in triplicate per treatment group) were left untreated in culture, infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-based vector (which transduces Tat and eGFP) or treated with TNFalpha.Keywords: parallel sample", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE2504"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Mar 08, 2013", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Effect of Ribavirin on Viral Kinetics and Liver Gene Expression in Chronic Hepatitis C", "overall_design": "Analysis of liver biopsy samples from 52 patients under 4 different treatment conditions.", "summary": "Background/Aims: Ribavirin improves treatment response to pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) in chronic hepatitis C but the mechanism remains controversial. We studied correlates of response and mechanism of action of ribavirin in treatment of hepatitis C.  Methods: 70 treatment-na\u00efve patients were randomized to 4 weeks of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/d) or none, followed by PEG-IFN alfa-2a and ribavirin at standard doses and durations. Patients were randomized to undergo a liver biopsy either 24 hours before, or 6 hours after starting PEG-IFN. Hepatic gene expression was assessed by microarray and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression quantified by the nCounter platform. Temporal changes in ISG expression were assessed by qPCR in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and by serum levels of IP-10.  Results: After four weeks of ribavirin monotherapy, HCV levels decreased by 0.5\u00b10.5 log10 (p=0.009 vs. controls) and ALT by 33% (p&lt;0.001). Ribavirin pretreatment, while modestly augmenting the induction of ISGs by PEG-IFN, did not modify the virological response to subsequent PEG-IFN and ribavirin treatment. However, biochemical, but not virological response to ribavirin monotherapy predicted response to subsequent combination treatment (rapid virological response, 71% in biochemical responders vs. 22% non-responders, p=0.01; early virological response, 100% vs. 68%, p=0.03, sustained virological response 83% vs. 41%, p=0.053). Ribavirin monotherapy lowered serum IP-10 levels but had no effect on ISG expression in PBMC.   Conclusion: Ribavirin is a weak antiviral but its clinical effect in combination with PEG-IFN seems to be mediated by a separate, indirect mechanism, which may act to reset the interferon responsiveness in HCV-infected liver.

A set of genes having an expression with high correlation to survival time after chemotherapy was identified.  Two of these genes were selected for validation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor tissue from 149 cisplatin treated patients having complete follow-up data.RESULTSFifty-five differentially expressed genes correlated significantly to survival time. Two of these (Emmprin and Survivin) were validated using IHC, and multivariate analysis (n=145) identified Emmprin expression (hazard ratio 2.38; p&lt;0.0001) and Survivin expression (hazard ratio 2.34; p&lt;0.0001) as independent prognostic markers for poor outcome, together with the presence of visceral metastases (hazard ratio 2.72; p&lt;0.0001).

In animal models, vasectomy affects different epididymal physiological and biochemical parameters. However, consequences of vasectomy on these biochemical parameters are poorly understood at the molecular level. Furthermore, results obtained with animal models cannot by extrapolated to human to understand the consequences of vasectomy on epididymal functions. Gene expression pattern of epididimydis is highly regulated. We previously showed that the human epididymal expression pattern of two genes is altered under vasectomy.

We defined an IGF-I gene signature pattern of hundreds of genes either up-regulated or down-regulated at both 3 and 24 hrs in vitro.  After removing genes considered generic to cell proliferation, the signature was examined in four different public profile datasets of clinical breast tumors (representing close to 1000 patients), as well as in profile datasets of experimental models for various oncogenic signaling pathways. Genes with early and sustained regulation by IGF-I were highly enriched for transcriptional targets of the estrogen, Ras, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways.  The IGF-I signature appeared activated in most estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) clinical breast tumors and in a substantial subset (~25%) of ER+ breast tumors.  Patients with tumors showing activation of the IGF-I signature tended to have a shorter time to disease recurrence (including patients not receiving adjuvant therapy), both when considering all patients and the subset of ER+ patients. We found evidence for cross-talk and common transcriptional endpoints between the IGF-I and estrogen systems.

To identify and functionally characterize genes involved in the mechanisms of osseous metastasis we developed a murine lung cancer model. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified genes encoding signaling molecules (such as TCF4 and PRKD3), and cell anchorage related proteins (MCAM, and SUSD5), some of which were basally modulated by TGFbeta in tumor cells and in conditions mimicking tumor-stroma interactions. Triple gene combinations induced not only high osteoclastogenic activity but also a marked enhancement of global metalloproteolytic activities in vitro. These effects were strongly associated with robust bone colonization in vivo, whereas this gene subset was ineffective in promoting local tumor growth and cell homing activity to bone. Interestingly, global inhibition of metalloproteolytic activities and simultaneous TGFbeta blockade in vivo led to increased survival and a remarkable attenuation of bone tumor burden and osteolytic metastasis. Thus, this metastatic gene signature mediates bone-matrix degradation by a dual mechanism of induction of TGFbeta-dependent osteoclastogenic bone resorption and enhancement of stroma-dependent metalloproteolytic activities. Our findings suggest the cooperative contribution of host-derived and cell-autonomous effects directed by a small subset of genes in mediating aggressive osseous colonization.Keywords: disease state analysis of human metastatic cell lines", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE10096"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Apr 02, 2011", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Gene expression pattern of skin biopsies of epidermolysis bullosa simplex patients in comparison with control subjects", "overall_design": "RNA used for the microarrays analysis was isolated from superficial 2mm punch biopsies composed of mainly epidermis with minimal dermis amounts of normal-appearing skin of six EBS patients ( two females and four males) and six healthy volunteers.", "summary": "Tha altered biological pathways in Epidermolysis bulloda simplex, a rare monogenetic skin disease, have not been well characterized.

Our previous results suggest that long term exposure to heregulin and forskolin changes the functional properties of the human Schwann cells, including the ability to myelinate axons after transplantation. Here, we propose to determine the molecular changes in the Schwann cells that occur as a result of extended growth with mitogenic factors. We believe that the information obtained in these studies will provide clues about mechanisms underlying the already observed changes in function. This information will aid in the prediction of the safety and efficacy of neural repair approaches that use cultured, expanded Schwann cells. Finally this data may provide clues into the mechanisms underlying normal human Schwann cell function.To use gene array analysis to compare gene expression profiles in early and late passage human Schwann cells exposed to the growth factors heregulin and forskolin.Observed changes in the function of human Schwann cells, including their capacity for growth and differentiation, after prolonged exposure to heregulin and forskolin, are caused by changes in the gene expression profiles in these cells.Nerves from four different donors were obtained within 12-15 h postmortem, with full consent for research from the families of the donors (faxed). IRB approval not required because subjects were officially dead at nerve harvest (IRB confirmation faxed). The nerve tissue obtained consisted of the lower 15 cm of nerve extending from mid calf to ankle. Endoneurial fascicles were dissected from short (1-2 cm) nerve fragments and cultured with heregulin and forskolin for 1 week.  The nerve fascicles were then treated overnight with collagenase and dispase and dissociated by gentle trituration.  Cells were plated at low density on laminin coated dishes and maintained in culture with mitogens for 3 passages.  Schwann cell purities during this period were &gt; 95%.   RNA was extracted from the cells  at passage 1 ( i.e. after 2 population doublings) and passage 3 (i.e. after 8 population doublings)  from the following donors: SN HSC 330, age 51; SN HSC 317, age 29; SN HSC 329, age 20 and SN HSC 351, age 42.  Thus eight samples (2 groups, 4 independent samples per group) are to be analyzed. Because both groups in this comparison have been exposed to mitogens, differences in gene expression profiles will be interpreted as indicative of changes caused by prolonged versus short term exposure to mitogens. More RNA was prepared from each group of cells than was needed for gene array analysis to allow confirmation of differentially-expressed gene transcripts by real-time RT-PCR.

Here we demonstrate that stimulation of these different Ca2+ influx pathways results in transcriptional activation of a distinct, yet overlapping set of genes, and that the induction of selected CRE-regulated genes is prevented by the addition of corresponding Ca2+ channel blockers.  Using oligonucleotide array analysis, changes in mRNA levels were quantified following membrane depolarization with K+ or depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin in human cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells.  Array results for differentially regulated genes containing a CRE were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, and corresponding changes in protein expression were shown by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence.  Membrane depolarization induced a transient increase in c-fos mRNA and a sustained increase in early growth response-1 (Egr-1) mRNA and protein that were inhibited by application of the VDCC blocker, nimodipine, and the SOCC inhibitor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB).  Thapsigargin induced a sustained increase in c-fos mRNA and MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) mRNA and protein, and these effects were decreased by 2-APB but not by nimodipine.

CYCLON knockdown was found to inhibit the aggressivity of MYC-overexpressing tumors in mice and to modulate gene expression programs of biological relevance to lymphoma.

Activating germline mutations of KRAS and HRAS cause severe developmental abnormalities leading to Noonan, cardio-facial-cutaneous and Costello syndrome, but activating germline mutations of NRAS have not been reported.  Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is the most common genetic disease of lymphocyte apoptosis and causes autoimmunity as well as excessive lymphocyte accumulation, particularly of CD4-, CD8- ab T cells.  Mutations in ALPS typically affect CD95 (Fas/APO-1)-mediated apoptosis, one of the extrinsic death pathways involving tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily proteins, but certain ALPS individuals have no such mutations.  We show here that the salient features of ALPS as well as a predisposition to hematological malignancies can be caused by a heterozygous germline Gly13Asp activating mutation of the NRAS oncogene that does not impair CD95-mediated apoptosis.  The increase in active, GTP-bound NRAS augments RAF/MEK/ERK signaling which markedly decreases the pro-apoptotic protein BIM and attenuates intrinsic, nonreceptor-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.  Thus, germline activating mutations in NRAS differ from other p21 Ras oncoproteins by causing selective immune abnormalities without general developmental defects.

Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment. Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929. Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells. We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells. Taken together, this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels.

We used two strategies to inhibit HAS: (1) cells were transfected with siRNA (HAS3 inhibited); a scrambled sequence was used as a control (HAS3 scrambled), and (2) cells were treated with the HAS inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU).

Methods. Breast cancer fragments were sliced and maintained in culture for 24 hours in the presence or absence (control) of calcitriol 0.5nM or 100nM (called physiological or supra-physiological concentrations). Five and 16 samples were included in a test or validation group and gene expression was analyzed by microarray (using SAM paired analysis) or qPCR, respectively. Results. Nine genes were regulated by calcitriol 0.5nM including CYP24A1, DPP4, EFTUD1 (FDR\u00a30.01), which were up-modulated. However, using a less stringent FDR value (0.25) 61 genes were differentially expressed. Among the down-regulated transcripts were members of the MHC class II complex (HLA-DPA1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB3) and IgG binding (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR2C). There was an enrichment of genes presenting transcription factor binding sites for vitamin D, among the up-regulated genes and for interferon regulatory factor IRF1, among the down-regulated genes. Analyzing calcitriol supra-physiological effects, a more impressive transcriptional modulation was identified and 136 and 60 genes (FDR 0.1) were more and less expressed in treated samples. Up-regulated genes were involved in vitamin metabolic process, regulation of leukocyte-mediated immunity and positive regulation of alpha-beta T cell activation. Many of the induced genes were already reported as vitamin D responsive genes, including CD14, which was also up-regulated in another set of 16 samples. Genes modulated by both calcitriol concentrations were CYP24A1, DPP4, CA2 (these three in both sets of samples), EFTUD1, TKTL1, KCNK3. Conclusion.

These results suggest that high-level HIV viremia inhibits monocyte function through chronic stimulation by IFN-?.  This effect of viremia on monocytes may play a role in diminished adaptive immune system functions in HIV-infected patients.  Restoration of these functions may contribute to the partial immune reconstitution observed following therapy and may be involved in immune reconstitution and inflammatory syndrome seen in some patients.Keywords: Longitudinal comparison", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE5220"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Jan 22, 2009", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Gene expression profiling of trophoblast cells", "overall_design": "To identify genes potentially regulating cell invasion trophoblast cells of early human gestation with distinct invasive properties were profiled.Distinct gene expression signatures of highly invasive EVT (n = 6) and poorly invasive CTB (n = 5) of different first trimester placentae using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips interrogating &gt;20,000 genes were determined.", "summary": "Invasion of cytotrophoblasts into uterine tissues is essential for placental development.

Real-time PCR analyses, Western blottting, and immunofluorescene of first trimester placentae and differentiating villous explant cultures demonstrated downregulation of HO-1 in invasive EVT as compared to CTB. Modulation of HO-1 expression in loss-of as well as gain-of function cell models (BeWo and HTR8/SVneo, respectively) demonstrated an inverse relationship of HO-1 expression with trophoblast migration in transwell and wound healing assays. Importantly, HO-1 expression led to an increase in protein levels and activity of the nuclear hormone receptor PPARgamma. Pharmacological inhibition of PPARgamma abrogated the inhibitory effects of HO-1 on trophoblast migration.

CysLTs acting through cysteinyl leukotriene receptors may influence the migration and activity of cells such as eosinophils, monocytes and dendritic cells.Objective: To determine the gene expression signature of human monocytes in response to cysLTs and to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in monocyte activation.Methods: Gene expression was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays. Responsiveness to cysLTs was assessed by real-time PCR, calcium flux, kinase activation and chemotaxis assays.Results: Cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptor (CysLTR1) transcript 1 is predominantly expressed in human monocytes and cysLTs signal through CysLTR1 in these cells. Several immediate-early genes, including early growth response (Egr) -2, 3, FosB, activating transcription factor 3 and nuclear receptor subfamily 4 were significantly induced by LTD4. This effect was mediated by CysLTR1 coupled to G\u03b1i/o, activation of phospholipase C, and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and store operated calcium channels. LTD4 induced p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, a pathway also involved in the regulation of immediate-early genes expression in monocytes.

Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP1,2) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP1,2 (VLPVP40-GP) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLPVP40 (particles lacking GP1,2) caused an aberrant response.

Previous studies have revealed that DC maturation is enhanced or accelerated upon MEK-ERK signaling pathway inhibition. We have now determined the contribution of MEK-ERK activation to the profile of gene expression of human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) and peripheral blood myeloid DC. ERK inhibition altered the expression of genes that mediate CCL19-directed migration (CCR7) and LDL binding (CD36, SCARB1, OLR1, CXCL16) by immature DC. Besides, ERK upregulated CCL2 expression while impaired the expression of DC maturation markers (RUNX3, ITGB7, IDO1). MEK-ERK-regulated genes exhibited an over-representation of cognate sequences for the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) transcription factor, and we show that AhR mediates some of the ERK-dependent transcriptional effects in DC. Therefore, MEK-ERK signaling pathway regulates antigen capture, lymph node homing and the acquisition of maturation-associated genes, and its contribution to the maintenance of the immature state of MDDC and myeloid DC is partly dependent on the activity of AhR. Since pharmacological modulation of the MEK-ERK signaling pathway has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer, our findings indicate that ERK inhibitors might influence the generation of anti-tumor responses through regulation of critical DC effector functions.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE39745"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Dec 01, 2008", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Expression data from MCF7 wt xenografts", "overall_design": "MCF7 xenografts were established in ovariectomized five to six week-old nu/nu athymic nude mice supplemented with 0.25 mg 21 day release estrogen pellets by inoculating subcutaneously (s.c.) 5E-6 cells.

The circumsporozoite (CS) protein, the major surface protein of sporozoites, traverses the PV membrane and enters the cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocytes. CS export into the cytoplasm requires the presence of pexel/VTS motifs. The transport of CS into the host nucleus is then mediated by importin (Imp) alpha3/beta1 that binds to the nuclear localization signal of CS localized in the conserved region II-plus. The NLSs of CS and of NFkB p50 share the same Imp. The entry of NFkB p50 into the nucleus is strongly inhibited in cell lines expressing CS, and in infected hepatocytes.  Micro-array data from CS expressing cell line shows that 40 NFkB targets were significantly down regulated.

Methods; We studied gene expression profiling of BCC tumour tissue coupled with laser capture microdissection to identify tumor specific receptor tyrosine kinase expression that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors.  The expression of selected molecules was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry.  The action of kinase inhibitors was examined on primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes.  Results; We found a &gt;250 fold change increase (false discovery rate &lt;10-4) of the   oncogene, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as well as its ligands, pleiotrophin and midkine in BCC compared to microdissected normal epidermis.  qRT-PCR confirmed increased expression of ALK (p&lt;0.05).  Stronger staining of phosphorylated ALK in BCC tumour nests than normal skin was observed by immunohistochemistry.  Additionally, Crizotinib, an FDA-approved ALK inhibitor, reduced keratinocyte proliferation in culture, whereas a c-Met, another receptor tyrosine kinase, inhibitor did not.  Crizotinib significantly reduced the expression of GLI1 and CCND2 mRNA by approximately 60% and 20%, respectively (p&lt;0.05).

HBP senses metabolic status of the cell and produces an essential substrate for O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which regulates target proteins via glycosylation. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that OGT is up-regulated in the protein level in prostate cancer (n=1987) and its expression correlates with high Gleason Score, pT and pN stages and biochemical recurrence (for all, p&lt;0.0001). Both a small molecule inhibitor and siRNAs targeting OGT decreased prostate cancer cell growth. Microarray profiling revealed that the principal effects of the OGT inhibitor in prostate cancer cells are on cell cycle progression and DNA replication.

The number of differentially expressed transcripts between the translocated and control cohort is significantly higher than that observed between control samples alone, suggesting that balanced rearrangements have a greater effect on gene expression than normal variation. Altered expression is not limited to genes close to the translocation breakpoint suggesting that a long-range effect is operating. Indeed we show that the nuclear position of the derivative chromosome is altered compared to the normal chromosomes. Our results are consistent with recent studies that indicate a functional role for nuclear position in regulating the expression of some genes in mammalian cells.

Co-cultures were carried out in quadruplicate.  The HIGK cells were lysed with Trizol (Invitrogen) prior to RNA extraction.  RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, labeled cRNA synthesis and chip hybridization were conducted as previously described (Handfield et al., 2005).  Briefly, total RNA was extracted from Trizol-lysed cells, treated with DNase I, purified and quantified according to standard methods (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; and Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed according to the Affymetrix protocol (SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit; Invitrogen,) with 8 \u00b5g of total cellular RNA used as a template to amplify mRNA species for detection.  Double-stranded cDNA was purified, and used as a template for labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) synthesis. In vitro transcription was performed using a BioArray high-yield RNA transcript labeling kit (T7) (Enzo Life Science, Farmingdale, NY), to incorporate biotinylated nucleotides.  cRNA was subsequently fragmented and hybridized onto Genechip Human Genome (HG) U133-A Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix) with proper controls.  Each sample was studied in parallel, and the samples were not pooled. The microarrays were hybridized for 16 h at 45\u00b0C, stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin and washed according to the Affymetrix protocol (EukGE-WS2v4) using an Affymetrix fluidics station, and scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 scanner.Microarray data analysis was performed as previously described (Mans et al., 2006, Hasegawa et al., 2008).  Briefly, expression filters were applied to remove Affymetrix controls and probe-sets whose signal was undetected across all samples. The signal intensity values of the resulting dataset were variance-normalized, mean-centered and ranked by their coefficients of variation.  Normalization was performed to give equal weight to all probe-sets in the analysis, regardless of the order of magnitude of the raw signal intensity. To reduce the confounding effect of background signal variation on the analysis, only the half of the dataset demonstrating the most variation across samples was used to perform unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis using Cluster software (Eisen et al., 1998). The resulting heat-map and cluster dendrograms were visualized with Treeview software Eisen  to reveal the extent of characteristic host cell responses to each infection state, defined as identical treatments clustering together.  Additional quality control data for the arrays is provided in the supplemental material.Following initial assessment of the host cell response to each condition, supervised analysis was performed to investigate differences in gene regulation among experimental conditions. For this analysis, the raw signal intensities were log2-transformed for all probe-sets that passed the initial expression filters, and were correlated using BRB Array Tools (Simon and Peng-Lam, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD). In each supervised analysis, biological replicates were grouped into classes according to their infection state during co-culture experiments and probe sets significant at the p &lt; 0.001 level between classes were identified. To test the ability of these significant probe sets to truly distinguish between the classes, leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) studies were preformed. In these LOOCV studies each array was left out in turn and a classifier was derived between the groups by selecting probe sets significant at p &lt; 0.001. The significant probe sets were then used with several prediction models (compound covariate predictor, nearest neighbor predictor, and support vector machine predictor) to predict the class identity of the array that was left out and not included when the classification model was built.

Following centrifugation, the mononuclear layer was removed and washed with PBS containing 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). The pellet was resuspended in 1X H-lyse Buffer (R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and washed with wash buffer. PBMCs contain mainly monocytes and lymphocytes as well as platelets that tend to be associated with blood monocytes.

Although these cells are often called \u201cuntouched\u201d monocytes and thought to show little activation, the gene chip analysis conducted on these cells shows massive changes in gene expression compared to PBMCs (see below).Monocytes were cultured in Macrophage Serum-Free Medium (MSFM, Invitro-gen, Carlsbad, CA) in the presence of 1% media supplement nutridoma-HU (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and 100 nM M-CSF for 6 days, after which the cells showed the expected morphological signs of macrophage differentiation. These macrophages were incubated either with 100 nM CCL2 or CXCL1 for 5 hours. CXCL1 was selected because we have previously found that it is an important arrest chemokine for monocytes in vitro and in atherosclerotic arteries in vivo. CCL2 was chosen because mice lacking CCL2 or its receptor CCR2 are relatively resistant to atherosclerosis, suggesting a role in macrophage recruitment, differentiation and/or survival. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were also incubated with native LDL, oxidized LDL (oxLDL) or minimally modified LDL (mmLDL) (each at a concentration of 100 ug/ml) for 2 days to induce foam cell formation. Foam cell formation was verified by oil red O staining (figure 1) and by determining their cholesterol and cholesterol ester content. OxLDL and mmLDL were prepared from the same native LDL for each experiment as described. Control experiments were conducted on macrophages cultured in M-CSF without LDL for an additional 2 days. Two separate sets of monocytes were incubated with CXCL4 (100 nM) for 6 days, another procedure known to induce macrophage differentiation (29), with and without oxLDL to induce foam cell formation.

We measured gene expression in periph-eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes and macrophages treated with CXCL1 (GRO-\u03b1) or CCL2 (MCP-1) as well as foam cells induced by native LDL, mmLDL or oxLDL using 22 Affymetrix gene chips. Using an advanced Bayesian error-pooling approach and a heterogeneous error model (HEM) with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05, we found 5,303 of 22,215 probe sets to be significantly regulated in at least one of the conditions. Among a subset of 917 candidate genes that were preselected for their known biological functions in macrophage foamcell differentiation, we found that 290 genes met the above statistical criteria for significant differential expression patterns. While many expected genes were found to be upregulated by LDL and oxLDL, very few were induced by mmLDL. We also found induction of unexpected genes, most strikingly MHC-II and other dendritic cell markers such as CD11c. The gene expression patterns in response to oxLDL were similar in MCSF-induced and CXCL4-induced macrophages. Our findings suggest that LDL and oxLDL, but not mmLDL, induce a dendritic cell-like phenotype in macrophages, suggesting that these cells may be able to present antigens and support an immune response.Keywords: PBMC, monocytes, macrophages, foam cells, chemokines", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE7138"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Dec 25, 2012", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Extraction of high quality total RNA from liquid nitrogen stocks", "overall_design": "Nine samples were analysed, composed of 3 biological replicates for each state (fresh, replated, frozen)", "summary": "Microarray expression arrays on THP-1 acute myeloid leukemia cell line samples, contrasting expression profiles of freshly harvested cell pellets, cells replated into fresh media for 24 hours and cells directly pelleted from liquid nitrogen stocks.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE30819"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Mar 16, 2011", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Differential gene expression in circulating leukocytes from chronically lonely individuals", "overall_design": "Gene expression profiling was carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA samples collected from 93 older adults participating in the Chicago Health Aging and Social Relations Study (CHASRS).

Using two independent computational approaches we utilized the CSR signature to identify clinically useful compounds that could target the CSR phenotype. In vitro assays confirmed selectivity of several predicted compounds including topoisomerase inhibitors and resveratrol towards breast cancer cell lines that exhibit a high-CSR phenotype.

The reason why ZAP-70 expression is associated with poor prognosis and whether the protein has a direct pathogenic function is at present unknown. By transfer of ZAP-70 to CLL cells, we show here that expression of ZAP-70 in CLL cells leads to increased expression of the NF-\u03baB target genes interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and IL-8 upon BCR triggering.

There is no effective therapy for metastatic PRCC, and patients are oftenexcluded from kidney cancer trials. A morphological classification of PRCC into Type 1 and Type 2 tumors has been recently proposed, but its biological relevance remains uncertain.PATIENTS AND METHODS. We studied the gene expression profiles of 34 cases ofPRCC using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 arrays (54,675 probe sets) using bothunsupervised and supervised analysis. Comparative genomic microarray analysis(CGMA) was used to infer cytogenetic aberrations, and pathways were ranked with a curated database. Expression of selected genes was validated by immunohistochemistry in 34 samples, with 15 independent tumors.RESULTS. We identified 2 highly distinct molecular PRCC subclasses with morphologic correlation. The first class, with excellent survival, corresponded to 3 histological subtypes: Type 1, low-grade Type 2 and mixed Type 1/low-grade Type 2 tumors. The second class, with poor survival, corresponded to high-grade Type 2 tumors(n=11). Dysregulation of G1/S and G2/M checkpoint genes were found in Class 1 andClass 2 tumors respectively, alongside characteristic chromosomal aberrations. Weidentified a 7-transcript predictor that classified samples on cross-validation with 97% accuracy. Immunohistochemistry confirmed high expression of cytokeratin 7 in Class 1 tumors, and of topoisomerase II\u03b1 in Class 2 tumors.CONCLUSIONS. We report 2 molecular subclasses of PRCC, which are biologicallyand clinically distinct, which may be readily distinguished in a clinical setting.Keywords: survival, prognostic classification, disease state analysis", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE2748"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Mar 22, 2012", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Exposure of an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, to one of four metals (arsenic, chromium, nickel or vanadium) to determine the early changes that lead to cell transformation", "overall_design": "A total of 39 samples were analyzed, consisting of 3 parental cell lines (BEAS-2B cells that were never seeded in agar or exposed to any metal), 11 controls cells (grouped into three sets, based on those seeded at the same time as the V-treated clones, the Cr-treated clones, or the As-treated and Ni-treated clones), and 25 metal-treated clones (7 each for Ni and As, processed in two separate batches of 3 and 4 clones each, 6 Cr clones and 5 Vanadium clones).

But the mechanisms, how a supernumerary chromosome disrupts the normal development and causes specific phenotypes, are still not fully explained. As an alternative to gene dosage effects due to the trisomic chromosome, a genome-wide transcriptional dysregulation has been postulated. The aim of this study was to define the transcriptional changes in trisomy 13, 18, and 21 during early fetal development in order to define whether (1) overexpression of genes of the trisomic chromosome contributes solely to the phenotype, if (2) all genes of the trisomic chromosome are upregulated similarly and whether the ratio of gene expression is in agreement with the gene dosis, (3) whether the different trisomies behave similarly in the characteristics of transcriptional dysregulation, and (4) whether transcriptional pattern can be potentially used in prenatal diagnosis. Methods: Using oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, U133 Plus 2.0), we analyzed whole genome expression profiles representing 54.000 probe sets in cultured amniocytes (AC) and chorion villus cells (CV) from pregnancies with a normal karyotype and with trisomies of human chromosomes 21, 18 and 13. Findings: We observed a low to moderate up-regulation for a subset of genes of the trisomic chromosomes. Transcriptional level of approximately 12-13 % of the supernumerary chromosome appeared similar to the respective chromosome pair in normal karyotypes. Expression values as well as the expression patterns of genes from the trisomic chromosome can distinguish the respective trisomic samples from euploid controls. A subset of chromosome 21-genes including the DSCR1-gene involved in fetal heart development was consistently up-regulated in different tissues (AC, CV) of trisomy 21 fetuses whereas only minor changes were found for genes of all other chromosomes. In contrast, in trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 vigorous downstream transcriptional changes were found. Interpretation: Global transcriptome analysis for autosomal trisomies 13, 18, and 21 supported a combination of the two major hypotheses. As several transcriptional pathways are altered, complex regulatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of autosomal trisomies. A genome-wide transcriptional dysregulation was predominantly observed in trisomies 13 and 18, whereas a more to chromosome 21 restricted expression alteration was found in trisomy 21.Keywords: Trisomy, Down syndrome, Patau syndrome, Edward syndrome, microarray, gene expression, amniocytes, chorion villus cells, gene dosage effect, DSCR1", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE6283"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Dec 20, 2011", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Gene expression profiling in A2780, CP70 and CP70 following Decitabine and/or PXD101 treatment", "overall_design": "Gene expression profiling was obtained from A2780, and CP70 before and after Decitabine and/or PXD101 treatment.

We performed genome-wide DNA (SNPs arrays), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) analyses to investigate the significance of 17p loss in a panel of 71 genetically well-characterized B-CLLs in Binet stage A, 18 of which carried a TP53 monoallelic deletion. Combined SNP arrays and FISH approaches showed 17p loss in all of the TP53-deleted cases, with breakpoints scattered along the 17p11.2 region. Mutations in exons 5 to 9 of TP53 were found in 9/12 deleted samples. GEP of 60 B-CLLs, including 7 patients with 17p loss, identified 40 differentially expressed genes in 17p- versus 17p normal samples, 35 of which were down-regulated in 17p- tumors.

In addition, HCV infection elicits a much broader range of gene expression alterations in addition to ISG induction. The induction of type III IFNs is mediated by IRF3 and NFkB- dependent pathways. Type III IFN, aside from upregulating ISGs with a different kinetic profile, induces a distinct set of genes from type I IFN, potentially explaining the functional difference between the two types of IFNs. Chimpanzees undergoing experimental HCV infection demonstrated a prompt hepatic induction of IL28, associating with ISG upregulation, but minimal type I IFN induction.

It is highly expressed in most medulloblastomas and amplified in a subset of them. The role of OTX2 in medulloblastoma and its downstream targets are unclear. Therefore, we generated D425 medulloblastoma cells in which we can silence endogenous OTX2 by inducible shRNA. Silencing of OTX2 strongly inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in a neuronal-like differentiation. Expression profiling of time courses after silencing showed a progressive change in gene expression for many cellular processes. Down regulated genes were highly enriched for cell cycle and visual perception genes, while up regulated genes were enriched for genes involved in development and differentiation. This shift in expression profiles is reminiscent to changes described to occur during normal cerebellum development. OTX2 is expressed in proliferating granular progenitor cells, but the expression diminishes when these cells exit the cell cycle and start differentiating. ChIP-on-chip analyses of OTX2 in D425 cells showed that cell cycle and perception genes were direct OTX2 targets, while regulation of most differentiation genes appears to be indirect. These analyses provide the first insight in the molecular network of OTX2, demonstrating that OTX2 is essential in medulloblastoma and directly drives proliferation by regulating the expression of cell cycle genes.

These data suggest that KSHV-encoded miRNAs may contribute directly to pathogenesis by down-regulation of THBS1, a major regulator of cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis.Keywords: comparison, experiemental versus control", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE7554"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Jun 15, 2006", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Identifying targets of MeCP2 during neuronal maturational differentiation", "overall_design": "The series GSE4600 submission consists of 12 samples representing data from three biological replicates with four treatments (UD, D-UT, D-MD, and D-CD) per one replicate experiment.

Data from each sample consisted of dChip derived PM-only model gene expression index from four SH-SY5Y treatments:1. Undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, i.e. before PMA induced differentiation (UD) (Sample ID - GSM102825, GSM102842 and GSM102870).2. 48 h differentiated and untransfected cells (D-UT) (Sample ID - GSM102875, GSM102876 and GSM102877).3. 48 h differentiated and MeCP2 decoy transfected cells (D-MD) (Sample ID \u2013 GSM102878, GSM102879 and GSM102880).4. 48 h differentiated and Control decoy transfected cells (D-CD) (Sample ID \u2013 GSM102881, GSM102882 and GSM102883).Affymetrix HG U133 plus 2.0 genechips were used.

Additional functional studies were also conducted on interesting and relevant neuronal targets of MeCP2.", "summary": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor elevated in mature neurons and is predicted to be required for neuronal maturation by regulating multiple target genes. Identifying primary gene targets in either Mecp2-deficient mice or human RTT brain has proven to be difficult, perhaps because of the transient requirement for MeCP2 during neuronal maturation. In order to experimentally control the timing of MeCP2 expression and deficiency during neuronal maturation, human SH-SY5Y cells undergoing mature neuronal differentiation were transfected with methylated MeCP2 oligonucleotide decoy to disrupt the binding of MeCP2 to endogenous targets. Genome-wide expression microarray analysis identified all four known members of the inhibitors of differentiation or inhibitors of DNA binding (ID1, ID2, ID3 and ID4) subfamily of helix-loop-helix (HLH) genes as novel neuronal targets of MeCP2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed binding of MeCP2 near or within the promoters of ID1, ID2 and ID3, and quantitative RT-PCR confirmed increased expression of all four Id genes in Mecp2-deficient mouse brain. All four ID proteins were significantly increased in Mecp2-deficient mouse and human RTT brain using immunofluorescence and laser scanning cytometric analyses. Because of their involvement in cell differentiation and neural development, ID genes are ideal primary targets for MeCP2 regulation of neuronal maturation that may explain the molecular pathogenesis of RTT.Keywords: Neuronal Differentiation, Targets of MeCP2, Rett syndrome.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE4600"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Mar 29, 2013", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Expression Analysis of Microdissected Inflammatory Breast Cancer", "overall_design": "Gene expression profiling of 20 inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), 20 non-IBC and 5 normal was studied.", "summary": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a unique clinical entity characterized by rapid onset of erythema and swelling of the breast often without an obvious breast mass.

Runx2, an osteoblast master transcription factor, is aberrantly expressed in PCa cells, and promotes their metastatic phenotype. The transcriptional programs regulated by Runx2 have been extensively studied during osteoblastogenesis, where it activates or represses target genes in a context-dependent manner. However, little is known about the gene regulatory networks influenced by Runx2 in PCa cells. We therefore investigated genome-wide mRNA expression changes in PCa cells in response to Runx2.Results: We engineered a C4-2B PCa sub-line called C4-2B/Rx2dox, in which  doxycycline (Dox) treatment stimulates Runx2 expression from very low levels to levels observed in other PCa cells. Transcriptome profiling using whole genome expression array followed by in silico analysis indicated that Runx2 upregulated a multitude of genes with prominent cancer-associated functions. They included secreted factors (CSF2, SDF-1), proteolytic enzymes (MMP9, CST7), cytoskeleton modulators (SDC2, Twinfilin, SH3PXD2A), intracellular signaling molecules (DUSP1, SPHK1, RASD1) and transcription factors (Sox9, SNAI2, SMAD3) functioning in epithelium to mesenchyme transition (EMT), tissue invasion, as well as homing and attachment to bone. Consistent with the gene expression data, induction of Runx2 in C4-2B cells enhanced their invasiveness. It also promoted cellular quiescence by blocking the G1/S phase transition during cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the cell cycle block was reversed as Runx2 levels declined after Dox withdrawal.Conclusions: The effects of Runx2 in C4-2B/Rx2dox cells, as well as similar observations made by employing LNCaP, 22RV1 and PC3 cells, highlight multiple mechanisms by which Runx2 promotes the metastatic phenotype of PCa cells, including tissue invasion, homing to bone and induction of high bone turnover. Runx2 is therefore an attractive target for the development of novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches to PCa management. Targeting Runx2 may prove more effective than focusing on its individual downstream genes and pathways.", "experiment_type": "Expression profiling by array"}, "model": "searcher.moduledescription", "pk": "GSE24261"}, {"fields": {"status": "Public on Apr 01, 2008", "organisms": "Homo sapiens", "title": "Gene expression profile in HUVECs before and after Angiopoietin stimulation", "overall_design": "To identify the genes in HUVECs which are upregulated or downregulated by the stimulation with Angiopoietin-1 in the presence (confluent) or absence (sparse) of cell-cell contacts, mRNAs were prepared from either confluent HUVECs or sparse HUVECs stimulated or unstimulated with 100 ng/ml COMP-Ang1 (more potent Angiopoietin-1).
